                  <em>Early childhood</em>  
                  <p>Virat Kohli was born on November 5, 1988, in Delhi, India, to Prem and Saroj Kohli. His father worked as a criminal lawyer, while his mother was a homemaker. From a young age, Virat showed signs of being highly energetic and curious. Family and friends often described him as a bright child who was drawn toward sports more than anything else.
                  Growing up in the Uttam Nagar area of Delhi, Virat attended Vishal Bharti Public School, where teachers noticed his strong interest in cricket. Unlike many children who played casually, Virat would often spend long hours practicing batting. His father recognized this passion early and supported him by enrolling him in the West Delhi Cricket Academy when Virat was just nine years old. This decision became the turning point in his life.

His family recalls that Virat would carry his bat everywhere and was deeply serious about improving his game even at a young age. He balanced studies with cricket, but the game always held a special place in his heart. The values of discipline, determination, and focus, instilled during his childhood, laid the foundation for the cricketer he would later become.</p>

His breakthrough came in 2006 when he played for Delhi’s Ranji Trophy team, famously batting the day after his father’s death. That courage and dedication marked him as a special talent, setting the stage for his future as one of India’s greatest batsmen.</p>
